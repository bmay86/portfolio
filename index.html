          </div>

          <p>
            I’m based in Charlotte, NC, where my background in audio engineering
            taught me that every detail matters. Precision, clarity, and problem
            solving were part of every session, and that same mindset shapes the
            way I approach software today. I build clean interfaces, intentional
            user experiences, and practical solutions that make sense in the
            real world. I care about clarity, structure, and writing code that
            feels as polished as a well-mixed track.
          </p>

          <p>
            My current goal is to grow into full-stack development, creating
            responsive layouts, building interactive components, and connecting
            them to APIs and databases. This portfolio will continue to expand
            with projects that reveal how I think, how I learn, and how I
            approach building digital experiences.

                Structuring the Foundation with HTML

              <p class="thought-date">Feb 2025</p>
              <p class="thought-text">
                Today I focused on understanding how HTML shapes the structure
                of a page. I practiced writing semantic elements, organizing
                content logically, and building layouts that feel intentional.
                What surprised me is how much clarity proper structure brings to
                the rest of the stack. Clean HTML sets the tone for
                accessibility, styling, and the way JavaScript interacts with
                the DOM.

              <p class="thought-text">
                CSS started feeling more intuitive today. I worked with Flexbox
                and Grid, experimented with spacing, and learned how small
                adjustments create cleaner, more intentional layouts.
                Understanding how elements flow and respond across different
                screen sizes changed the way I think about design. It's
                satisfying seeing a layout go from scattered to structured with
                just a few lines of CSS.

              <p class="thought-date">Feb 2025</p>
              <p class="thought-text">
                JavaScript opened up a new layer of understanding today. I
                practiced working with variables, functions, and DOM events to
                add interaction to a page. Once I saw how the DOM responds to
                event listeners, JavaScript felt less abstract and more like a
                tool for shaping behavior. Every new concept builds on the last,
                and it's starting to feel like solving small puzzles piece by
                piece.

              <p class="thought-text">
                Today I built more confidence with Git and version control. I
                practiced committing changes frequently, creating branches,
                merging updates, and fixing small mistakes without losing
                progress. Understanding how Git tracks history makes the whole
                development process feel safer and more structured. It’s a tool
                that rewards clarity and encourages clean, intentional work.

              <p class="thought-text">
                I spent time studying responsive design and how layouts adapt
                across screen sizes. Working with media queries and flexible
                units helped me think beyond a single device. Clean
                responsiveness isn’t just a visual detail — it shapes how
                someone experiences a page. Building with intention means
                designing for everyone, not just one screen.
