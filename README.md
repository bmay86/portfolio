# Developer Portfolio Website

This project is my personal developer portfolio, built to represent who I am as a creator and the kind of work I want to bring into the world. The site reflects my style clean, modern, focused, and designed with intention. It gives me a place to share what I am learning, the projects I am building, and the skills I continue to strengthen as I move deeper into full stack development.

I designed this portfolio with a dark luxury aesthetic because I wanted something that feels calm, polished, and precise. The layout adapts smoothly across all devices, and the navigation is built to stay out of the way while keeping everything easy to reach. Every part of the interface is shaped to feel intentional, from the animations to the card layouts to the way each section snaps into place.
